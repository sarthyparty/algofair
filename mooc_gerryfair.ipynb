    "## Required Data Format\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to train and audit for bias, we require three dataframes. The first two are the standard `X` and `Y`, which are the samples and their labels respectively. These should be one-hot-encoded. The third required dataframe is the list of protected attributes. This contain the values of the protected attributes for each row in the sample. These will be the attributes that we will audit for bias towards. Please note that we do not promise to protect against bias towards attributes that are not included in this list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cleaning Data\n",
    "If your data is not in that format, it needs to be cleaned. We provide a method, `clean_data` in *clean.py*, you can use to clean your data into the accepted format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable `dataset` should hold the file path to the file containing the dataset. The variable `attributes` should hold the file path to the file containing protected attributes. This should simply be one row where a column is 2 if it is the label, 1 if it is protected, and 0 otherwise. You should set `centered` to be `True` if you want the data to be centered."
